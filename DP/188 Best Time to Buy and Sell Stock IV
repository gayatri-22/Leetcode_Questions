Problem 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer k. Find the maximum 
profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k transactions.
Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.

Example 2:

Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 
(price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.

Solution:

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
        return maximumProfit(prices, 0,1,k, new HashMap<String,Integer>());
}

private int maximumProfit(int[] prices, int currentDay, int canBuy, int transCount, HashMap<String,Integer> memo){

    if(currentDay>=prices.length || transCount==0)
       return 0;

    String currentKey=currentDay + "-" + canBuy + "-" + transCount;

  if(memo.containsKey(currentKey))
     return memo.get(currentKey); 
     int ans=0;

    if(canBuy==1){
        int idle= maximumProfit(prices, currentDay+1, canBuy, transCount,memo);
        int buy= -prices[currentDay]+ maximumProfit(prices, currentDay+1, 0, transCount,memo);
        ans = Math.max(idle,buy);
    }else{
        int idle= maximumProfit(prices, currentDay+1, canBuy, transCount,memo);
        int sell= prices[currentDay]+ maximumProfit(prices, currentDay+1, 1, transCount-1,memo);
        ans= Math.max(idle,sell);
}
    memo.put(currentKey,ans);
      return ans;
            
    }
}
